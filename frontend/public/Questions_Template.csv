Which of the following is not a type of automaton?,Deterministic Finite Automaton,Pushdown Automaton,Turing Machine,Regular Expression,Regular Expression,Regular Expression is not an automaton; it is a formal language representation.
The language accepted by a DFA is always:,Context-free,Recursive,Regular,Recursively Enumerable,Regular,DFA defines Regular Languages by definition.
Which of the following has more computational power?,NFA,DFA,Both have same power,Depends on input,Both have same power,NFA and DFA are equivalent in terms of language recognition.
A Pushdown Automaton (PDA) is more powerful than DFA because:,It has a stack memory,It uses nondeterminism,It reads multiple symbols at once,It is faster,It has a stack memory,The stack in PDA allows it to handle context-free languages.
The language {aⁿbⁿ | n ≥ 0} is:,Regular,Context-free but not regular,Context-sensitive,Recursively enumerable,Context-free but not regular,This language requires a stack to count matching a's and b's.
Which of the following is not true about regular languages?,Closed under union,Closed under intersection,Closed under complement,Closed under infinite concatenation,Closed under infinite concatenation,Regular languages are closed under finite operations but not under infinite concatenation.
A Turing Machine can simulate:,DFA only,PDA only,Both DFA and PDA,None of these,Both DFA and PDA,Turing Machine is the most powerful model and can simulate all lower automata.
The pumping lemma is used to prove:,A language is regular,A language is not regular,A grammar is ambiguous,A machine halts,A language is not regular,Pumping lemma is used to show that a language cannot be regular.
Which of the following problems is undecidable?,Membership problem for DFA,Membership problem for CFG,Halting problem for TM,Equivalence problem for DFA,Halting problem for TM,Halting problem is undecidable; no algorithm can solve it for all cases.
The intersection of two context-free languages is always:,Context-free,Regular,Not necessarily context-free,Empty,Not necessarily context-free,Intersection of two CFLs is not guaranteed to be context-free.
Which of the following represents a context-sensitive language?,aⁿbⁿ,aⁿbⁿcⁿ,a*b*,0*1*,aⁿbⁿcⁿ,aⁿbⁿcⁿ cannot be generated by a PDA but can be by a linear bounded automaton.
"In a DFA, the transition function δ is defined as:",Q × Σ → Q,Q × Σ → P(Q),Q × Σ → Σ,Σ × Q → P(Q),Q × Σ → Q,"In DFA, transition is deterministic — one next state for each symbol."
Which of the following is true about ε-NFA?,It is more powerful than NFA,It is less powerful than DFA,It has same power as NFA,It cannot be converted to DFA,It has same power as NFA,ε-NFA and NFA recognize the same class of regular languages.
A language is recursively enumerable if and only if:,It is accepted by a DFA,It is accepted by a PDA,It is accepted by a Turing Machine,It is regular,It is accepted by a Turing Machine,Turing Machines recognize recursively enumerable languages.
Which of the following grammars generate regular languages?,Type 0,Type 1,Type 2,Type 3,Type 3,Type 3 grammars (right-linear or left-linear) generate regular languages.
